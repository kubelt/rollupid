3ID is the easiest way for developers to give users a consistent, friendly experience across apps. You're one query away from giving users a personalized experience that increases their trust and joy in using your product.

### 3ID Profile Request

Profile requests take the form `https://3id.kubelt.com/<resolver>/json`, where `<resolver>` is a unique account identifier (e.g. an Ethereum address). 

### 3ID Profile Response

```json

	"displayName": "Polynomics",
	"pfp": {

	},

### Custom User Data

Using 3ID means you don't have to worry about storing user data -- your users can store it themselves!

In order to store your own custom application data within a user's 3ID profile you will need to use a custom application namespace as well as our new encrypted storage RPC methods. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/UgwAsJf6C5) to talk to us about your use case and get beta access.
