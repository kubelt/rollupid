## tap

General configuration for tap tests is as described [here](https://node-tap.org/docs/using-with/).

NB: it is currently necessary to name test files with a `.mjs` extension rather than `.ts`.

Look at these issues for further information:
* [node-tap issue #653](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap/issues/653)
* [node-tap issue #679](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap/issues/679)
