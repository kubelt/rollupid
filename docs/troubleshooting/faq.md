# FAQ

## Where do I get support?

You can get support from the team by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rollupid) or documenting any issues at our [Github](https://github.com/proofzero/rollupid/issues).

## When will email authentication be supported?

We take user privacy very seriously. Email login requires more investment than third-party and wallet login services. You can track the work on this [here](https://github.com/proofzero/rollupid/milestone/6).

## When will WebAuthn be supported?

We're working on that now. Check out progress [here](https://github.com/proofzero/rollupid/milestone/6).&#x20;

## What is a Vault and when will it be available?

Vault is an ETH "burner wallet" linked to a user identity and can be created by developers using progressive authorizations. Access to these wallet is governed by advanced OAuth scopes and available over API and is perfect for onboarding non-technical users to blockchain powered applications.

You can check out progress on this feature [here](https://github.com/proofzero/rollupid/milestones).
