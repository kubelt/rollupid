# Overview

Rollup improves user experience in apps with secure and progressive authorizations. It helps build trust and privacy between users and apps. We make relationships between developer and user easier for developers and users to with a set of tools for easy and secure logins, resulting in a single user profile.

Access to this profile is controlled with an OAuth-like system called 0xAuth. 0xAuth is a standard OAuth implementation with extensions to handle authorizations to a users profile. To learn more what you can do with 0xAuth authorizations, check out the [Scopes Reference](../reference/scopes.md).

\[TODO - add a diagram of the profile graph]

Like any OAuth system, to get started you'll need to create an application in [Console](create-an-application.md). Once you've created an application, you can start using the [Galaxy API](../reference/galaxy-api.md) to interact with your users.
