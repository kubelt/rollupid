# Overview

Rollup is authorization infrastructure designed for easy and secure logins with progressive authorizations to rich user profiles.

Access to this profile is controlled with an OAuth-like system called OAuth. OAuth is a standard OAuth implementation with extensions to handle authorizations to a users profile. To learn more what you can do with OAuth authorizations, check out the [Scopes Reference](../reference/scopes.md).

Like any OAuth system, to get started you'll need to create an application in [Console](create-an-application.md). Once you've created an application, you can start using the [Galaxy API](../reference/galaxy-api.md) to interact with your users.
