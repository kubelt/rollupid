description: Get to know your way around Rollup

Rollup is a platform that looks and feels like a traditional auth system, but we take it one step further. We go beyond authentication and provide both users and developers with a unified profile graph that can be used to build relationships between users and applications.

Access to this profile graph is controlled with an OAuth-like system called 0xAuth. 0xAuth is a standard OAuth implementation with extensions to handle authorizations to a users profile. To learn more what you can do with 0xAuth authorizations, check out the [Scopes Reference](../reference/scopes.md).

[TODO - add a diagram of the profile graph]

Like any OAuth system, to get started you'll need to create an application in [Console](./create-an-application.md). Once you've created an application, you can start using the [Galaxy API](../reference/galaxy-api.md) to interact with your users.
