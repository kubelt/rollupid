# API Access

Once you've successfully integrated Rollup ID and authenticated your users you can now make authorized requests to the [Galaxy API](../reference/galaxy-api.md) and [Passport API](../reference/passport-api.md).&#x20;

The Galaxy API is both a [REST API ](https://galaxy.rollup.id/swagger)and [GraphQL](https://galaxy.rollup.id/graphql) API.&#x20;

When calling the API, **you'll need to include the** [**Galaxy API key**](create-an-application.md) from your app and, in some cases, the signed JWT/access token.
