description: An introduction to 3ID concepts.
---

3ID is a way to organize distributed networking resources. There are a couple of
key concepts that will be useful to understand our technology.

## Profile

[Profile](../profile/index.md) is a decentralized user profile that developers use to personalize their UX.

## Passport

[Passport](../passport/index.md) is 3ID's authentication and authorization system.

## Console

[Console](../console/index.md) is where developers create **0xAuth** apps.

## Galaxy

[Galaxy](../galaxy/index.md) is 3ID's GraphQL system.

## Glossary

### 0xAuth

**0xAuth** is 3ID's OAuth-standard authorization system with extensions to handle authorizations in decentralized systems, including blockchain.

### Nodes

3ID is organized around a decentralized graph. Nodes in that graph represent
people and applications, and developers can use them to organize decentralized
software services around users.

### URNs

Uniform Resource Names, **URNs**, are how resources within the 3ID graph are identified.
