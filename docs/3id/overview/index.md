# Introduction to Rollup

Rollup is an open source auth and identity platform designed around [OAuth standards](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) and inspired by [W3C decentralized identity](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/). With Rollup, you can focus less on integrations and more on growth with tools that streamline user onboarding and acquisition.

What sets Rollup apart from other auth solutions is Rollup's ability to turn users into identities bundled with **federated identity services**. By using our progressive authorization framework, **** apps to request scoped access to a users [identity graph](../../platform/profile-graph.md) directly from their users. With this model you can foster secure and trustworthy relationships with your users and eliminate privacy compliance overhead.

And by using standards we can all of this easy.
