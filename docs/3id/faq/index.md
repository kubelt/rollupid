## What is a "core"?

"Cores" are a [fundamental concept](../overview/index.md#cores) in 3ID. Cores
are graph nodes that represent people or applications. They are used to organize
decentralized services. Cores are an important internal technical abstraction so
you may see chat messages, code, or documentation that referrs to them.
