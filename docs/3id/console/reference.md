The Console 0xAuth page allows you to configure your 0xAuth and white labelling
settings. Use the **Save** button in the top-right corner of the page to commit
any changes you make.

## 0xAuth Settings

**0xAuth** is our standard implementation of OAuth, extended to support
decentralization. This section shows your 0xAuth Application ID and Secret. Like
in standard OAuth, these are effectively your application's username and
password for the 0xAuth authorization scheme.

### Roll Keys

"Roll Keys" allows you to generate a new secret and expire the existing one.

## Application Status

The **Published** toggle shows you whether your application is available publicly.
You can change its status and click **Save** at the top-right of the page in order
to hide (left) and expose (right) your application.

This will not delete your application (see [Danger Zone](#danger-zone), below).
