# Console

[Console](https://passport.threeid.xyz) is where you create and manage 3ID applications.

![Console Application Details](../img/console-app-details.png)

This dashboard shows you:

* Your Galaxy GraphQL API key. This key gives you access to [Galaxy](/3id/galaxy/index.md)
where you can query all of your configured scopes (see the [Console Reference](/3id/console/reference.md)
for more information.

* Your 0xAuth Application ID and Secret. Like in standard OAuth, these are effectively
your application's username and password for the 0xAuth authorization scheme.

* Smart Contracts and Logins. Connect smart contracts to your 3ID application to
import the account addresses of token holders. Owners of these accounts who connect
to your 3ID application will be shown under "Logins", along with contact information
they have shared with your application.
