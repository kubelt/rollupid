# ðŸ†” 3ID Public Profiles

3ID is the easiest way for developers to give users a consistent, friendly experience across apps. You're one query away from giving users a personalized experience that increases their trust and joy in using your product.

## 3ID Profile URLs

Profile requests take the form `https://3id.kubelt.com/<resolver>/json`, where `<resolver>` is a unique account identifier (e.g. an Ethereum address). All resolvers for the same person link to the same 3ID profile, so someone can sign in with a wallet or login with their Google Account and have the same experience.

**This makes it really easy to onboard Web 2.0 users to web3 products.**

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/UgwAsJf6C5) to tell us which resolvers you want. Here's the current list:

| Resolver | Description                | Example                                    | Status |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Ethereum | Ethereum account addresses | 0x3DaC36FE079e311489c6cF5CC456a6f38FE01A52 | Live   |
| ENS      | ENS domain names           | alfl.eth                                   | Live   |

## Making a Request

```bash
curl https://3id.kubelt.com/0x68dc0Ee494FF6546C2547409F89C2cf097EE4722/json
```

Or with `fetch` on the client or server:

```javascript
fetch('https://3id.kubelt.com/0x68dc0Ee494FF6546C2547409F89C2cf097EE4722/json').then(p => p.json()).then(profile => {
	console.log('User-set display name:', profile.displayName)
	console.log('URL for user-set PFP: ', profile.pfp.image)
	console.log('URL for user-set cover photo: ', profile.cover)
	console.log('Where the user says they are:', profile.location)
	console.log('What the user says their job is:', profile.job)
	console.log('User-specified biography text (256 characters):', profile.bio)
	console.log('User-specified website URL:', profile.website)
	console.log('System-set boolean indicating if a user has claimed this profile:', profile.claimed)
})
```

## 3ID Profile Response

If you feed the above `curl` through a tool like `jq`, for example with `curl https://3id.kubelt.com/0x68dc0Ee494FF6546C2547409F89C2cf097EE4722/json -s | jq`, you get the profile JSON object:

## Custom User Data

Using 3ID means you don't have to worry about storing user data -- your users can store it themselves!

In order to store your own custom application data within a user's 3ID profile you will need to use a custom application namespace as well as our new encrypted storage RPC methods. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/UgwAsJf6C5) to talk to us about your use case and get beta access.
