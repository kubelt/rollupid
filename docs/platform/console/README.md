# Console

Console is your control centre where you register and manage all your applications.  Below is an incomplete tour of the Console app.

### Navigation

The navigation consists of two main sections.

At the top right you have your profile menu. Here is where you can sign out and visit your [Profile](broken-reference).

On the left is your application context menu. Here is where you can toggle between your applications and also create new ones.

### Application List

The very first screen you will see in Console is the list of all your applications in one place. You can also create apps from this screen using the "Create Application" button.
