## Kubelt Monorepo Tour

Let's take a look around at the Kubelt Monorepo layout...

The Kubelt monorepo tooling configuration and scripts:

- [bb/](bb/) directory contains some build tooling for use with [babashka](https://babashka.org).
- [bzl/](bzl/) directory contains miscellaneous tooling for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), one of the build tools that we use.

### Other

- [rdf/](rdf/) directory contains various RDF vocabularies, examples, and data fixtures used during development.

#### NIX ENV

Install NIX and run `nix-build` to install nix packages and `nix-shell` to execute a shell with a fully configured development environment.

Note that docker doesn't fully work using nix packages.
